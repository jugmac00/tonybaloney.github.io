## “What makes Python a great language?” by Steve Dower

“If you came expecting a well researched article full of citations to peer-reviewed literature, you came to the wrong place. Similarly if you were hoping for unbiased and objective analysis. I’m not even going to link to external sources for definitions. This is literally just me on a soap box, and you can take it or leave it.”

## My own posts from this year

I’ve been quiet on the blogging front this year because work has been so, so, so busy as I’m in the middle of an $11bn merger. But here are the major things I published:

[Review of Azure Pipelines with Python]

[A letter of encouragement to the Python community in Africa]

I explored the sub-interpreters support in 3.8 and their impact on the Python GIL
[Has the Python GIL been slain?]

I looked at code complexity and how to refactor Python effectively
[Refactoring Python Applications for Simplicity](https://realpython.com/python-refactoring/)

Then I wrote a (very) long article about CPython 3.8’s source code
[Your Guide to the CPython Source Code](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/)

This will be a book published in 2020!

Thank you for reading,
Have a great holiday and New Year
